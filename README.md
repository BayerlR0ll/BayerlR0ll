👋 Hi, I’m @BayerlR0ll
### Quick Programmer Bio
- My name is AJ, and I am a .NET developer for an insurance company. I'm pretty green as a developer, having only been in the role for almost a year as I was wrapping up my computer programming certificate program at my local community college. Initially, I was on a team that focused on maintaining legacy rating software written in VB.NET and C#. Over the course of the last 5-6 months, I've worked more with security and modernization efforts in Azure and implementing Okta authentication. Prior to being offered the developer role, I was a QA at the same company, with involved writting automated test cases in C# and Selenium and database querying using SQL. 

👀 I’m interested in... 
- Just honing my craft and trying new challenges. My main background is using C# in .NET framework. However, the most recent projects I've been involved with entail working a lot with Azure web apps and APIs. 

🌱 I’m currently learning...
- I've been learning a lot about Angular lately for my team's Okta implementation project.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Not really sure, but I'm willing to try my hand at just about anything.
